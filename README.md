A computer cluster is a set of connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike traditional desktop computers, clusters have greater computing capacity ideal for problems related to Computational Fluid Dynamics, Machine and Deep Learning, Bioinformatics, Data Science, Computational Physics and others.

## Who can use the Cluster

* Undergraduate, masters and doctoral students at Universidad del Valle related in a research project.
* Agreement with other universities (in development).

## How to Getting Started

1. Your advisor must send an email (through the institutional address) to laboratorio.redesysd@correounivalle.edu.co with subject **Acceso al Cluster**. Plase, use the following template.

```
Cordial saludo,

Mi nombre es <your_namer_here>, estudiante de <your_career_here> de la Universidad del Valle. Estoy trabajando en <your_research_subjet>, dirigida por el profesor <advisor_name>. Por lo anterior, requerimos hacer uso del cluster de la universidad.

Para lo anterior se requieren los siguientes programas: 

 - FFmpeg (https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) versi√≥n 4.5
 - Convnetjs (https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs)
 - Japronto (https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto)

De antemano muchas gracias,
```

2. You will receive an email with the credentials for the cluster. Additionally, we will assign you a student from the laboratory (a tutor) who will be responsible for following your process in the use of the cluster until the end of your research process.

3. You should follow the tutorial to use the cluster. When the assigned tutor specifies that you are ready to use the cluster, he will enable your access credentials.

4. You must sign the cluster usage policy.

5. At the end of the research process we ask you to fill out the user satisfaction form for the cluster.

## Do you want to be a tutor?

A tutor helps other researchers to use the cluster properly, this is a voluntary work that aims to promote the advantages of using the computational cluster.
